Road safety is a very sensitive issue in the world today because millions of accidents occur 
every year as a result of various factors, which may include human mistakes, vehicle faults, or 
environmental causes. Among these factors, driver drowsiness is prominent as it accounts for 
approximately 20% of all road accidents. Drowsiness cripples a driver's focus and reaction, 
which often results in tragic occurrences. This is an issue mainly in a world where busy people 
travel long distances and have professional drives. 
Such risks are mitigated by modern technology. Recent advancements in computer vision and 
machine learning enable the real-time monitoring of drivers, with non-intrusive signs of 
drowsiness detection. Technologies aim to focus on physical and behavioral cues such as 
prolonged closures of the eyes, head movements, and facial expressions of drivers. Such 
systems identify the onset of fatigue and alert the driver before accidents happen. 
The system in this project, Real-Time Drowsiness Detection System, captures real-time video 
streams using a webcam and utilizes computer vision algorithms to analyze eye movements in 
the driver's face. This system checks whether the eyes are open or closed by using the Eye 
Aspect Ratio (EAR). If this exceeds a certain threshold, an alert is sent to make the driver focus 
on the road again. The system is designed to be deployed in various conditions and is scalable 
for the implementation in modern vehicles, resulting in worldwide safer transportation systems.
